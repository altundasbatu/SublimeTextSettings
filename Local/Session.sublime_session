					"contents": "# Prologue: Meet the Goddess\n\nBeing reborn in a world was... a new experience to say the least.\n\nBeing reborn in a world that you remembered from some Light Novels and Anime was a concerning experience.\n\nBeing reborn in a world that you remembered from Anime with an ability from another unrelated Anime was... it just got too confusing for my new life.\n\nI was born in a remote farming village, about a month of travel from the Dungeon City of Orario. Given that said city was considered to be the Center of the World, everyone and their grandmother knew of the place. It also meant that I knew of the world I was born in, the world of \"Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in the Dungeon\" or more commonly referred to in my old world as the World of \"Danmachi\". While the content that was known in my world were focused around the adventures of Bell Cranel and his shonen adventures while unwittingly gathering a harem of girls, underneath the whole sunshine and rainbows was a world of slavery, capricious gods and a type of power plays expected in the world of Game of Thrones.\n\nMy parents named me Merlin, making me find it ironic given that I was essentially named after the most famous Wizard in my old world. It was also ironic given that I seemed to have picked up something else upon my death... an ability that made me more confused than anything. The ability I had was a simple one... <Mystic Eyes of Death Perception>. It was an ability I recalled from another world, one that allowed a person to observe lines and points of Death that would allow one to kill something by cutting said lines. It was also an indicator of another set of skills that had to potential to allow me to return home... probably... if I could harness the Kaleidescope. I was not sure if I had <Magic Circuits> but I could not activate them yet, as my newborn body had nothing to activate them with.\n\nI was born to a simple peasant family, meaning my new life would be very boring if I chose to stick to the status quo... which I did not want to. Being a Magus was dangerous in the best of times but I was a Magus in the times when Gods walked among men, in a world where Magic had not faded, a world where it was still the Age of Gods. If I wanted master my powers and figure out a way to get back home, I would need resources and materials... which the dungeon would provide. The idea of going to Orario and joining a Familia had some merits just from the boost that the Falna would provide... along with all the potential discoveries I could make with the help of materials from the Monsters in the dungeon.\n\nGiven my ambitions, the reality of it was less glorious. My first few years went with me trying to not loose my mind while working out how to master meditation. Being reborn as an infant was... an experience. Luckily, most of it was hazy and I was able to suppress most of the trauma associated with it. It gave me some time to think and focus on discovering what else I had in terms of abilities.\n\nThe first part of mastering Magecraft was the activation of my <Magic Circuits>. Apart from my eyes, which could see <Death Lines>, I was not sure if I even had Magic Circuits, but I needed to try and see if I had any, and figure out a way to compensate if I did not have them. Using a bit of thinking and testing, I came to the simple yet obvious solution that activating my <Magic Circuits>, ironically enough, required magical energy to begin with. It was why Meditation was the first step, to master my <Breathing>.\n\nFrom what I recalled from the confusing world of Nasuverse, <Breathing and Walking> was a method used to produce Mana. By becoming fully in sync with their body, a person could turn their body into a <Natural Magic Circuit> and produce Mana with each breath. Once Mana was produced, it allowed a person to activate their <Magic Circuits> by running the energy through their body. It was why most Magus required some trigger or incantation to activate it, the incantation acting as a control of the <Breathing> while the trigger acting as a built-in habit like a muscle memory.\n\nI was first able to activate my <Magic Circuits> at the age of four after nearly a thousand different methods that failed. It was a good thing that I was still young, given that the body adapted easier to said <Magic Circuits> earlier they were activated. After the first activation, I simply knew that I had twenty circuits of low quality as if the information simply became part of me... which was technically correct. <Magic Circuits> were part of a person's soul, even if they had a tendency to glow and had effects on the physical body. In the most simple terms, <Magic Circuits> were a bridge between the soul of a Magus and the real world that allowed them to enact their own will into Reality.  \n\nHaving learned lessons from Shirou Emiya and his way of using <Artificial Magic Circuits>, I was already aware that once turned on, the <Magic Circuits> stayed on. The activation portion was similar to running <Mana> produced from <Breathing> through your spine thought. The actual method that worked was to run the <Mana> through what I recalled were my 7 Chakra Nodes, from bottom up. \nThe method ended up unlocking each Chakra Node and pushing the Mana through my Crown Chakra into my Soul, where the actual <Magic Circuits> were located. \n\nTo use the <Magic Circuits> however required you to activate them using a special mental trigger, allowing for the <Magic Circuits> to influence the world.generate <Mana> the amount of which was determined by the quality and quantity of the <Magic Circuits>. While twenty circuits were average for a Magus, the low quality was something that I could improve on practice over time.\n\nOther than the normal <Magic Circuits> throughout my body, I was also flooded with the knowledge of twenty other circuits of high quality within my eyes but those seemed to be almost crystallized and unchanging. The only control I had over those was gaining the ability to toggle my <Mystic Eyes> on and off, which was useful in it's own way. Given that my first four years involved me seeing the <Death Lines> of the World around me, reclaiming my normal vision was... blissful.\n\nIt took another year before I was able to mentally tie an image for easy activation. The image I had used to first turn the <Magic Circuits> on, of a gun placed to the back of my head and getting cocked, was directly inspired by Shirou Emiya. My idea was that if it worked for him, it would work for me as well. It helped that this Medieval World would not have any guns that could accidentally trigger the activation. Tying the whole thing into a simple breathing pattern in the form of an incantation was almost second nature after that as I kept chanting \"Game On\" as I activated my circuits . Given a decade, the incantation would be reduced to a mental trigger only but for now, the incantation helped and I had time to get used to it.\n\nI did not mind the low quality of my <Magic Circuits>, even if the measly 10 units of Mana each to a total of 200 Mana. Waver Velvet had less that that and still managed to survive a Holy Grail War, so all I needed to do was master what I had. Practice and time would have them slowly develop into High Quality while I would have to depend on the Falna from a god to improve them to greater quality if need be.\n\nGiven that I had time until I could get to Orario, I should be able to rediscover at least the basics of Magecraft now that I was able to generate Mana. While modern Magus of the Nasuverse discarded the Three basic magecraft of <Structural Analysis>, <Reinforcement> and <Gradation Air> after getting simple mastery over them, said skills were exceptionally powerful if one understood how to properly use them. Shirou Emiya had managed to turn the three basics into something capable of matching the strongest of Servants and I was actually more knowledgeable than said moron thanks to hours spent reading the Wikipedia pages the figure out how Magecraft worked in Nasuverse. Granted, Emiya was an anomaly with being the <Incarnation of Sword>, having a distorted mindset bordering on schizophrenia that led to the formation of a <Reality Marble> and ultimate life hack in the form of Avalon, but I could probably match that. At least, I actually knew how to activate my <Magic Circuits> instead of converting my nerves into <pseudo-Magic Circuits>\n\nFirst part of training was control. I activated my Magic Circuits and started converting <Prana> into <Mana> and moving it inside my body, mixing it with the <Od> that was my Life Essence. Once I got the basics down, using the <Mana> to replicate some control exercises that I shamelessly ripped off from other Anime. I started working on the Three basic spells.\n\nFirst was the <Structural Analysis>. Inspired by the bats and how Sonar worked, I pushed my magic through stuff and felt for the echo. I want to say that I was able to get it to work on the first go but... it was not to be. It actually took me three years on near daily trial and error to get how to use <Structural Analysis>. Given that I had spent two years after my birth barely functioning and another two more to get my <Magic Circuits> activated, I saw that as an absolute win to be able to have the basics of <Structural Analysis>, or rather it's more simpler form of <Structural Grasp>, since I was limited by touch, by the age of seven despite all the headaches of information flooding into my brain with each time I cast the spell and causing a Migraine.\n\n<Reinforcement> was a bit more easier compared to <Structural Analysis> even if it was more dangerous. Though I could not get it completed without knowing the first of the three and applying <Reinforcement> to my own body was still just a pipe dream for the eight year old me. First part was understanding, which came from the <Structural Analysis>. Once I knew what I was looking at down to the atomic level, as well as on a conceptual level, I could push <Mana> around and hold it in places to reinforce their effects. It was harder than filling the gaps between atoms with magic, which made things have a greater durability but not much in the form of flexibility. Eventually, I was able to combine multiple minor reinforcements to make it less taxing and safer. Surface Tension of my cells, bonds between each cell, force exerted by my muscles and the speed of contractions all had to be reinforced at the same time to prevent something from breaking. I had to rely on the brave sacrifice of rabbits that I caught to test it out before I could apply it to my own body.\n\nFortunately, my new life parents were useful in teaching me the required life skills, though I could not say that we connected much. By the time I was nine, they caught onto something being different with me and decided to confront me about it. By confront me, I meant that they tried to drown me. With a bit of effort, I was able to pull off a simple <Hypnosis> by <Reinforcing> some of their thoughts to keep thing civil, requiring me to <reinforce> the effect of my words on their minds. I had managed to place the idea in their minds to ignore my peculiarities.\n\nUsing <Hypnosis> on my new parents made me come to terms with the fact that I was a Magus, or rather, it made me come to term with the fact of what a Magus actually was. `To be a Magus... to Walk in the Moonlit World, was to dance with Death` the saying went. Magus were amoral monsters in human flesh who preyed on those they viewed as their lesser... something I did not want to be. A week of depression that followed was ended when I decided to pull a Kiritsugu Emiya and used <Hypnosis> on myself to suppress the expectations I had unknowingly placed on my new parents from my mind. I would keep the name, mostly because I could not care to change it and risk the Falna I would get proving me a liar. It helped that it made me decide on my paht. If I was going to become a Magus in this world, I would become the best one, and the Magus of Flowers was as good as any even if there were a few problems in how the Dick Wizard was a pervert of the extreme caliber.\n\nAfter the whole \"drown the changeling\" phase of the family and my decision to remake myself into something more than what I was born as, I started planning. I was only nine, meaning I had at least five more years before the cannon came to be, given that the Zeus and Hera Familias were disbanded around the same time that I was born. Even if the village I was born to was far from Orario, stories traveled and legends that were the Adventurers were hear far and wide.\n\nThe realization that I could very well become a monster meant that, I needed something... or rather, someone who could ground me, and maybe curb my worse impulses. Best option was Hestia in that regard, not only because of the whole `Hestia is Bestia` thing or the actual bias I had for both the character in Danmachi but also because among all the Members of all Panthenons, Hestia was the only one that was not in some way vengeful, vain or capable of turning on you. Sure, Hephaestus or Miach would work better with my Magecraft but there was a chance that their greed or conditions they represent in the case of Miach's debt would lead to them pushing me in some unethical directions. There was also Hestia being extremely affectionate and having a smaller and unknown Familia that would allow me greater freedom and less pressure.\n\nDriven by my decision, I managed to work out an actual <Mystery> at the age of nine. While the basics of Magecraft were useful, the <Mystery> they held was simply the basics of energy manipulation instead of anything complex like what I was trying to do at that moment.\n\nThe <Mystery> that I had woven into a single piece of donkey skin was based on knowledge I gleamed from <Structural Analysis>. I had bought the skin after the donkey of the neighboring farm passed from old age. Paying the owner what little money I could make from helping out around the village on my off time along with selling the rabbit furs from the rabbits that I took to breeding in the backyard for my experiments. With <Structural Analysis>, I was able to slowly focus on the connection a Hearth of a Home had to something outside a property shared by the Donkey Skin.\n\nThe Conceptual Knowledge was the first part of the trippy part of Magecraft, beneath the surface of the physical information, of Atoms and Quarks was the world of <Concepts> and figuring out the <Concept> of the Hearth was a daunting challenge of it's own. Binding said concept to a donkey skin made sense in my head. It required some knowledge but if one knew that Hestia's, or rather her Roman Counterpart, Vesta's symbols included the donkey, the connection was there to begin with. Using my budding skills in <Alteration,> which was the transition phase between <Reinforcement> and <Gradation Air>, to imbue the <Concept> of the Hearth to a piece of Donkey Skin essentially converted the piece of leather into what I called `Mantle of Hestia`.\n\nI felt her presence once I was able to get the Cloak to completion before I felt the magic in the cloak slowly change and stabilize into something that I could not make yet. I realized that the cause for change was from a part of her Divine Power and she felt... unique, made me feel insignificant, like I was being observed for a moment before it felt so much like my mother's touch from my first life. It felt like the endless compassion of a parent, the comfort of home and it felt like a warm embrace and pure acceptance that I did not know that I craved. I wiped away the tears that I felt trickle down my cheeks.\n\nOnce I had managed to create the Mantle, I could actually feel the <Mystery> bind itself to the material, I could feel that Hestia had actually blessed the piece of cloak, stabilizing my work with her own Arcanum. Hestia was still in Tenkai, so she was probably able to use her Arcanum and feel me. I must have been judged worthy, given that I was not immediately turned into cinder, but the `Mantle of Hestia` was now something woven with the <Mystery> that bound it to Hestia. It took me a while to understand what I had actually done with the Cloak and how the magic inside it worked, but I had not much success. Other than having the best nights sleep in my bed while using the cloak as a blanket, I drew a blank on it's use as the best way to describe Mantle was `it feels like home`. It did make me always feel warm even in winter but that was probably an obvious side effect of the Mantle being essentially a Conceptual Fire of a Hearth in it's own way.\n\nThe Mantle allowed me to progress in it's own way as well. Using <Structural Analysis> on the Mantle, over and over again until I understood the method that Hestia used to bless the material, allowed me to mimic the process and improve my Magecraft, allowing me to unlock the next stage of <Magecraft> in a way.\n\n<Gradation Air> was one of the most complex things I had come across up to that point. Like <Reinforcement> being built upon <Structural Analysis>, <Gradation Air> built on <Reinforcement> in some ways. There were a few tricks that I found to work best but the general concept of <Gradation Air> was that it was the first step into combining <Mana> produced from my <Magic Circuits> with the <Prana> in the environment. <Gradation Air> allowed one to weave <Prana>, or World's Natural Magical Energy with <Mana> to influence the world around me in a way.\n\nThe method that worked the best was essentially tricking the world into thinking that an object existed in the Air. It was the inverse of how <Structural Analysis> worked in application. Where <Structural Analysis> took information about an object into the Mana and back to the Caster, <Gradation Air> took the Mana containing information and weaved it into the Air and the <Prana> in the air. What followed was essentially an illusion akin to Prestidigitation from Dungeons and Dragons Games. Until the Mana inserted into the conjuration dispersed, the Universe thought that there was an object there, so there was an object there for all intents and purposes. The degradation from Mana dispersion meant that the object slowly degraded until it was dispersed which was what gave the process it's name of <Gradation Air>.\n\nI was able to experiment with the process and figure out how Emiya worked out a variation of the <Gradation Air> into <Projection>. <Projection> was essentially an improved form of <Gradation Air>, containing not only information of the object, but also all the physical properties of it, combined by the way of <Reinforcement>. In effect, a knife made with <Gradatation Air> was a knife that was very fragile even if it was a knife for all purposes even if it would barely be able to cut something. For the purpose of a ritual or some Magecraft where the knife was sacrificed to provide the Concept of Cutting into another object, <Gradation Air> worked. Comparatively, <Projection> created a knife, then Reinforced the air that made up the knife to match the physical properties of the original knife. It was not an exact copy of the knife, due to the entropy causing at least some effect on the process, but it was still a knife if slightly of lesser quality.\n\nThere were other side projects that I had also started working on... ones meant to make be better at fighting Monsters. My initial aim was to figure out if I could use my Magecraft to improve my own physical body. Since I had decided to become an Adventurer, I knew that I would get a Falna. From all that I could recall, Falna amplified everything that was already there, so better I became, greater boost I could get from my Falna in the future.\n\n<Structural Analysis> and <Reinforcement> combination worked on many basics of Magecraft as I learned. Running <Structural Analysis> on myself allowed me to get a deeper understanding of myself, providing me with the start of the pathway to understanding my <Elements> and awakening my own <Origin> even if it was still some time away. Those were things that I would have to be careful with, as unlocking my <Element> and <Origin> would make learning other forms of <Magecraft> harder. That would require me to run <Structural Analysis> on my own soul, if my theory was correct, and that was a long way away given that I was barely handling the information overload from the Biological and Biochemical information I was getting.\n\nBiologically, I was able to use <Structural Analysis> to figure out a lot of things. A few dozen rabbits were sacrificed to SCIENCE before I was able to slowly figure out some improvements to my own body, like using <Mana> to boost my healing rate, or using <Mana> to purge Lactic Acid buildup through rapid degradation so I could fight longer. Any cancer cells were easy to detect with magic and I was able to target those cell and use <Reinforcement> to make them burst, so most of my modifications were cancer free at least. I would need some decent <Mystery> to figure out greater healing effects but forcing my blood to clot from a wound was the difference between life and death and I could use some potions to compensate if need be.\n\nGiven the difficulty and danger of using <Reinforcement> on myself without practice, I started developing a simple Spell based on <Projection>. The spell was simple, allowing me to use <Projection> to create Rose Petals in the air. I did get inspired by Merlin from Fate Series but the idea had some merit on it's own. Rose Petals were complex, biological and extremely fragile. They also could be combined with <Reinforcement> to have extremely sharp edges that worked well with my <Mystic Eyes of Death Perception>. Giving me an offensive weapon that was not a knife or a sword made sense and the process of casting the spell allowed me to refine biological <Reinforcement> and gave me a simple spell to act as distraction if needed.\n\nThe <Structural Analysis> of my own brain gave me a new and interesting discovery to the field of <Pionics> or <Mental Magic>. I had already used <Reinforcement> to allowed me to achieve a form of <Hypnosis> and <Self Hypnosis> but those had been things that I had done out of necessity rather than actual desire.\n\nThe most important part was that <Psionics> would allow me to rediscover a method to replicate the Magecraft of the Atlas Institution, <Thought Acceleration> and <Parallel Processing>. The two Mental Magics were what I would need to survive if I chose to make my profession as a Dungeon Delver. The idea was simple, using <Parallel Processing> to cast spells, hold <Reinforcement> over my body and make up tactics while my body was simultaneously fighting for survival, while <Thought Acceleration> would give me more time to react and faster cast times.\n\n<Thought Acceleration> was far from a simple application of Magecraft. It was a derivative of the <Reinforcement> that required a person to try their best into making their brains essentially into a Magical Superconductor. The whole concept of a person using only 10 percent of their brain might have been wrong on multiple levels, but when it came to signal to neuron density, it was not so far fetched. There were biological limiters in place to prevent every neuron in the body from firing at once and it was for a perfectly explainable reason. Given that human brain produced enough energy to light a lightbulb in a slow day, simultaneously firing all the neurons would lead to the brain going through multiple stages of heat stroke in a second, shutting down to prevent cell death, the body going into shock and potentially causing your now flash boiled brain to leak out from your eyes. Reinforcing the electrical conductivity essentially sped up the Neurons and improved the Thermal Performance. Using <Reinforcement> to improve the heat dissipation from brain to the capillaries in the brain had the heat transfered over the whole body through the blood, preventing heat build up. I did not mess with hormone production to prevent messing with my brain anymore but there were still multiple methods that I had tried on rabbits that I was able to add to my own practices. The entire process allowed me to more than double my Perception when activated, though that process required me to keep my focus on accelerating.\n\nUnlike <Thought Acceleration>, <Parallel Processing> was not simply based around <Reinforcement>. While <Parallel Processing> built on the foundation of <Thought Acceleration> in that, the <Reinforcement> of the Brain was needed to even achieve the basics of parallel processing, it was more <Conceptual> than Physical. I had to leverage the neuron structure to trick the biology into assuming that the brain was in fact two separate brains. The result was two processes running simultaneously. The process, which was something I tested out on rabbits first, first used <Reinforcement> to isolate a part of the brain, something I found easier to achieve by having at least some sensory organ attached to the isolated part. The results were... trippy. Once the parts were isolated, the brain assumed that it was working with rest, using the connections that it had to keep functioning. The first rabbit that did succeed in achieving this stage instead of having it's head explode consequently developed a Multiple Personality Disorder, after I stopped the isolation. I was able to fix that problem by slowly cycling down the <Thought Partition> using <Reinforcement> but it was still a Headache inducing experience. The only reason that I was sure that I did not accidentally give myself a stroke was that <Structural Analysis> had the brain working as it should afterwards.\n\nBy the time that I was twelve, I had built the basics of my Magecraft. I had a strong foundation in the most useful things that I could recall from the Nasuverse, combined with a rather thick notebook that held all my notes containing my theories.\n\nUnfortunately, my relationship with my family was non-existent as a result of my Magecraft Shenanigans. Apparently, they thought that I was either replaced by a Spirit or was possessed by one before I managed to influence them to leave the though out. At least I was able to curb their violent tendencies and superstitious fear of anything magical after the first incident.\n\nThe result was that I was more akin to a distant relative who lived in the same farm as they did, doing chores that they gave me, and even saved my new father from losing his leg after he broke it, using Magecraft and simple medical knowledge to set the bone and prevent infection by using <Alteration> without adding anything, moving things around until they returned to the places and connected to the things that they once had been.\n\nFrom a physical point, I made sure to work out as much as I could. Every morning, I would go out on a run around the farm, followed by chores that I would modify into being simple physical exercises. There was even a retired soldier in the village, a veteran of some war where he lost an eye. He was willing to teach me some swordplay and spear-play for helping around in his farm. I was lucky that he was not some pedophile even if he was slightly perverted. I sometimes wondered how I ended up befriending an old soldier with potential PTSD whom I could help out as much as I could. It took some work but after I was able to get past the Old Man's PTSD with a bit of <Hypnosis>, he was far more eager to help train me in sword and spear.\n\nEven with all the practice, I cheated as much as I could. A bit of help from <Structural Analysis> to replicate all the methods the bloody sword the man owned and I had the basics of swordsmanship to complement my training, building Muscle Memory through practicing moves I learned from the history of the blade.\n\n---\n\nI woke up on my Sixteenth Birthday, not knowing that today would be different than all the days before. I pushed my <Mana> into the <Mantle of Hestia>, as part of the general routine that I had built included using <Structural Analysis> every morning on the Mantle, but today gave me something different... something unusual. Today, I couldn't feel Hestia's presence in the cloak... or rather, the personality that was always there is now dulled... muffled as though a wool was covering it. It could only mean one thing, the lack of personality that was linked to Hestia's Arcanum and that meant that today was the day that Hestia descended into this world. A second Analysis and I am pretty sure that it is not the spell work getting unwoven or decaying. The connection to Hestia's Arcanum was there, but the Arcanum that defined Hestia's Divinity just lacked her personality.\n\nA few moment later, I had a bag over my shoulder, containing my book, the Mantle, a pair of clothes and some money I had saved up. The knife that I had attached to my belt completed all the earthly possessions I had, with a small bonfire burning all that I could not bring with myself to Orario, which included some materials that I was working for improving my <Magecraft> not that they were not replaceable.\n\nI told my birth parents that I was leaving, ignoring their half-hearted protests. Putting a traveling cloak over my should and I was out the door, heading to the nearest City to find a Caravan heading to Orario. I did not know if I would manage to get back to my world... but I knew that this farm... this place... it was not my home.\n\nI was going to Orario.\n\nI was going to Hestia.",

Made from Silk and Water Elemental Ether Clump through <Polymorphization>, the process gives the Silk the properties associated with the Water Element and protection from it.\n\nUndine Cloth is special blue cloth imbued with the power of an Undine/Water Spirit. The cloth is resistant to water based attacks and heat. It also enables the user to swim better in water and reduces water resistance and water pressure. The effects of the Undine Cloth are comparable to the Diving Development Ability\n\n# Salamander Wool\n\nModified form of the original that uses the Salamander Spirit to create instead of <Mystery>. Made from sheep wool and Fire Elemental Ether Clump through <Polymerization>. The process gives the Wood the properties associated with the Fire Element and protection from it.\n\nCreated by imbuing a cloak with a Salamander's magic power. It protects against fire and the cold \n\n--- Potions --- \n\n# Honey Cloud Wine\n\nWine made by MC from the Honey Cloud Fruit on 18th Floor.\n\nThe drink contains it's own unique <Mystery>. Since it is made from materials from the Dungeon, the . The Honey Cloud is a Fruit, therefore classifying the drink as a wine. The naming of the fruit and association to honey allow the drink to be also classified as a mead.\n\n\n# Elixir\n\nWhile Elixir can only be made using *Mystery* and *Mixing* Developmental Abilities, MC figures out that two people can do it if they have one of each Developmental Abilities.\n\nMade from <Polymerization> of a Dual Potion made from using *Mixing* on Healing and Mana Potions and the (Dungeon Sap) along with <Reinforcement> powered by the Magic Stone of a Level 3 Monster. The (Dungeon Sap) allows Elixir to store Magical Energy to a degree.\n\n# Nectar\n\nMade from combining Honey Cloud Wine, Elixir, (Dungeon Sap) and blood of a God using both *Mixing* and *Mystery*.\n\nNectar is the drink of the gods. It burns away the mortality of those that drank it, burning away humans. It can however be used on the blood of Adventurers to create the Ichor of their respective God (or so it is assumed. Using the blood of your own god along with your blood creates).\n\n\n# Greek Fire\n\nMade from mixing (Dungeon Sap), Ground (Kaenseki) Powder and regular Black Powder that MC had Naaza create using her skill of *Mixing*. Unlike the typical explosion of Kaenseki, <Greek Fire> burns a green magical flame when exposed to heat that is impossible to putout and can burn underwater. The nature of the material makes it capable of being fed on from Magic Stones making it a great use against Monsters.\n\nWelf uses Greek Fire as part of his forge, specifically at a separate cleared area far away from anything else.\n\n<Eternal Flame of Vesta> is ignited with Greek Fire along with other ingredients, with the Greek Fire allowing for Magic Stones to be fed to enhance the magical nature of the fire.\n\n--- Metals ---\n\nBlood Onyx:\n\nA mineral found in the Middle Floors.\n\nUsing *Mystery* the Blood Onyx can be used as a components that can be Attunable using the blood of a person.\n\nWelf creates kunai for Mikoto using Blood Onyx that are enchanted by MC to return to a special made belt through <Imaginary Numbers> Plane with blood as anchors at the cost of stamina.\n\nMC creates <Mana Stones> after combining with Magic Stones and Blood Onyx through <Alchemy> which store Mana in stones that act more like a <pseudo-Familiar> that MC can pull Mana from.\n\nNosteel:\n\nA mineral from the Lower Floors that lacks an <Identity> allowing it to be smelted by a *Blacksmith* with other materials to gather the properties of those materials into a metallic form containing the properties of the Drop Items..\n\nMC is confused by the material as the name `Nosteel` means that theorizes that it is a metal that lacks identity which can be supplemented by other materials. A person with *Blacksmith* Developmental Ability can use Nosteel and other Drop Items to give a blade <Origin> belonging to the Monster that the the Drop Item came from while ensuring that the end result is indeed metal. Nosteel can act as catalyst to convert drop items into metal through smelting process by a *Blacksmith*\n\n\t- Muramasa: A special alloy made by smelting (Swordstag Antlers) and (Nosteel) by Welf and MC using a combination of *Blacksmithing*, *Metalworking* and *Mystery* Development traits before using <Alchemy> to remove the identity of `stag` from the blade. The method gives the identity and <Origin> of `Sword` to the material that is smelted. This allows for the Welf to forge a Conceptual Sword that MC calls a \"Muramasa Blade\" or a sword with the <Origin> of \"Sword\". This leads to the creation of one of the key insights that Welf needs in creating an actual stable Magic Sword that does not break.\n\nAdamantite:\n\nA rare metal from the dungeon which is the second strongest material in the world. It can be found in all the floors of the dungeon but the deeper the floor from which it is extracted, the purer it will be, being the one from the Deep Floors the purest version, which is proportionally related to its hardness. According to Ottar, only a Level 6 or higher can break pure Adamantite.\n\nMC notes that it is less a metal and more a crystal. It's structure is similar to diamond, it's chemical properties are that of carbon but it's structure made up of metallic bonds which allow it to be reforged like steel. The nature of Adamantite contains it's own <Mystery>, providing increased strength.\n\nMithril:\nA material with a high magical conductivity, which is why it is commonly used in the creation of magic staves or weapons used by people who combine magic with their fighting style. It has great resistance which it is difficult for an upper-class adventurer to break it. It is also a great material due to how easy it is to work with. Its manufacturing method is similar to that of Oricalchum.\n\nBase component of Mithril is Silver.\n\nOricalcum:\n\nThe highest quality material in the world as well as the most resistant. Its manufacturing method was established in the Ancient Times, combining human and demi-human techniques. A blacksmith with the development ability Blacksmith can give it the Durandal attribute to use it in the creation of Superiors, virtually indestructible weapons.\n\nBase component of Oricalcum is Bronze.\n\n# Adamantine\nRefined Adamantite made in the same way as Oricalcum and Mitril, requiring *Mystery* and *Metalworking* Development Abilities. \n\n\n# Stygian Iron\n\nA Metal Alloy crafted with the use of Welf's *Blacksmity* and *Metalworking*, Naaza's *Mixing* and MC's *Mystery* DA's.\n\nIron blessed in the method of Mitril and Oricalcum, tempered in the (Waters of Styx) that MC pulled from the underlying reality that allowed souls to be transported to Tenkai through a mix of <Space Magic>, Prayer and <Mystic Eyes of Death Perception>. The Iron is tempered in the (Waters of Styx) to be made indestructible accept for a specific location the size of a pinhead, as MC figures that there is a basic rule about \"anything that has a beginning should have an end\" after failing to create a completely indestructible armor. The metal has a special nature that makes it impossible to be wielded by anyone who does not have a connection to Death, making MC the only mortal capable of using it.\n\n- Stygian Iron Knife\n\tA Mystic Code for MC that amlifies the effects of the <Mystic Eyes of Death Perception> providing a way for MC to cut <Death Lines> from far away\n\n- Avalon MK7\nArmor used by MC made to be Indestructible and capable of nullifying any attack by killing it.\n\n# Corinthium\n\nAn Alloy of Mitril and Oricalcum based on the Corithian Bronze that contains both properties of it's base components. It is created by MC and Welf using <Alchemy> to create a material with the properties of both Oricalcum's strength and Mitril's magical conductivity. Instead of creating an alloy of Oricalcum and Mitril, the process requires the starting with Corinthian Bronze, an alloy of bronze and silver, and using <Alchemy> have the material pass through the required treatment process to make both Oricalcum and Mitril.\n\nThe material forms the basis of Unbreakable Magic Swords with the Durrandal attribute that Welf and MC work on at later stages of their research.\n\n# Cold Iron\n\n# Titanite\n\nA material that MC and Welf figure out. It is made from Titanium processed in the methods of (Oricalcum).\n\n",

Zanis was a bastard... that was without question. He was also a bastard with a sense of self preservation. When a Level 1 claimed to be strong enough to threaten a Level 2, either they were hot-headed, which the way I was acting did not mesh with, or they had something that they had under their sleeve.\nZanis leaned back, \n\n\"You see, before I came here... meeting Hestia to get my Falna, I saw the results of your... management.\" I said, throwing a sword handle and a crossguard that I had kept from my travels. \"I would say that some of your members not being filled with their share of Soma and turning to Banditry to seek alternatives is... enough of an indicative of how much you such as a Captain. Guild would probably level some serious fines for causing them to move on to Banditry...\"\n\"Ah... I see.\" said Zanis... now really concerned. I had claimed to match a Level 1, mid to high level without even a Falna, so there was something to be worried about. I had also claimed that I could cause more in damages than he would be able to afford. \"1 Million Valis then.\"\n\"You mean 100 thousand.\" I said with a smirk. I felt the guy behind me stiffen at the implied threat.\n\"You...\" said Zanis, standing up, as I felt a hand on my shoulder. My hand clamped on the hand on my shoulder. My grip closing with a strength powered by <Reinforcement>. Compared to rapid bursts of speed, continuous strength was a different type of trick... one that was actually simpler if you knew how to best leverage it.\n\"Chandra... right?\" I asked, seeing the man whose wrist I was squeezing. \"\n",

					"contents": "# Heaven's Feel\n\nOne of the methods theorized by MC to allow him immortality akin to Godhood to allow him to spend eternity with Hestia.\n\n\nThe <Third Magic>, also called Heaven's Feel, is the materialization of the soul, which stops the inevitable dispersion of the soul once it no longer has an anchor to the world, and essentially makes it transcend to a higher form of existence. It is a magic that realizes true immortality by making the soul into a high-dimensional planar being capable of interacting with the material world as a mental body without having to return to Akasha.\n\n\n\n## Holy Grail War\n\nThe original concept and the method of Heaven's Feel has been lost to time, however the Einsbern Family had secretly designed the Holy Grail War as a way to open a path to the Root and reclaim the Third Magic.\n\nThe Ritual used a complex mixture of Thaumaturgy to achieve it's purpose.\n\nEinzbern Family's main magecraft, <Wishcraft> was used to power the Mystery of the Grail once completed, allowing for the realization of wishes with six servants as fuel or the realization of Heaven's Feel Ritual with the seven servants as fuel to punch a hole into the Root. <Dress of Tenkai> the Mystic Code for Heaven's Feel and the body of Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern act as the core of the Greater Grail with Justeaze's inefficient method of using Heaven's Feel acting as the primary form of reaching the Servants in the Throne of Heroes and materializing them into the modern world.\n\nTohsaka Family's Jewelcraft was used to allow for the collection of the Magical Energy from the Leylines of Fuyuki by the Greater Grail to start the Holy Grail Wars as well as collect the sacrificed souls of the Servants into the Lesser Grail.\n\nMatou Family's <Crestworms> were used as the basis of providing the <Command Seals> that controlled the Servants, along with providing them with a path to refuel their Mana.\n\nWhile the entire connection to the Heaven's Feel is not known, MC was able to come up with a working theory. The Grail is designed to use the Souls summoned from the Throne of Hero's as fuel to open a path to Akasha. While the exact reason is never mentioned, MC theorized that the use of souls that are recorded in the Throne of Hero's could be replicated to allow for a soul to retain cohesion post-mortum.\n\nThe mechanics of the process are simple. There exists two grails, <the Greater Grail> is built under the Fyuki City to be powered by the intersection of the 3 Ley-lines that flow with Prana. It acts as a giant battery (thanks to Tohsaka <Jewelcraft>) that allow for the storage of enough Mana to summon Seven Heroic Spirits. The Greater Grail used a weakened form of <Heaven's Feel> belonging to Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern who in turn makes up the core of <the Greater Grail>, to call Heroic Spirits.\n\nOn the other hand, <the Lesser Grail> is a vessel provided individually for each Holy Grail War by the Einsberns, in the form of a Humonculi. <The Lesser Grail> stores the sacrificial power from the fallen Heroic Spirits with the intention of using six Servants to power a Spell product of <Wishcraft>, or seven Servants to amplify the existing connection to the Root with enough power to rebuild the path to Root through the <Third Magic>, powering a <Wishcraft> with the sacrifice of Heroic Spirits as a catalyst.\n\nMC notes that it is essentially the use of 7 incomplete Heaven's Feels to create a single perfected one.\n\n## MC's Version\nnote: that the Materialization of the Soul prevents the decay of soul normally associated with the reincarnation process.\n\n\nThe basis of the Modified Heaven's Feel Ritual is the concept of the Eternal Flame belonging to Hestia.\n\n### Tower of Babel\nThe basis of MC's work is actually built on the work of Ouranos and Fels on the Tower of Babel.\n\nThe Tower of Babel is designed to work similar to <the Lesser Grail> with the combined work of Falna. The Falna stores the Legend of a person in the form of <Mystery> that leads to the formation of a Heroic Spirit, with the Arcanum of a God powering the Adventurers akin to a Master-Servant bond. Upon death of an Adventurer, their Soul is stripped of their identity and fed back to the cycle of reincarnation, while the potential Heroic Spirit is absorbed by the Tower to power the protections.\n\n\n",
